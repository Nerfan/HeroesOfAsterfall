Beta 3.2
Fixed a bug where every unit got the Paladin's light shield ability
Abilities now properly check for durability
Abilities will no longer go through if no targets are selected
Enemies can now properly retaliate for the Pierce and Supernova abilities
Enemies now actually get to act on their turn and players do not act on enemy turns
Fixed a problem where the list of targets in the GUI was not resetting upon action
Added the ability to back out of an ability cast (split the Done button into a Done and Back)
A unit's action is not taken if the action fails
** Not yet fully implemented:
Advanced classes now have proper level up stats and a method has been added to promote players
No way to access that method as of now

Beta 3.1:
Added abilities for advanced classes (Still need level up stats)
Added the ability to change level
Added Player and enemy phases (one action per unit per phase)
Fixed the RNG
